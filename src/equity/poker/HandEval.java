/**
 * Non-instantiable class containing a variety of static poker hand evaluation and related utility methods.
 * <p>
 * All of the methods are thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * Each evaluation method takes a single parameter representing a hand of five to
 * seven cards represented within a long (64 bits).  The long is considered as
 * composed of four 16-bit fields, one for each suit.  The ordering of these
 * 16-bit fields within the long, i.e., the correspondence of each to a specific
 * suit, is immaterial.  Within each suit's 16-bit field, the least-significant
 * 13 bits (masked by 0x1FFF) are flags representing the presence of ranks in
 * that suit, where bit 0 set (0x0001) for a deuce, ..., bit 12 set (0x1000) for
 * an ace.  The values of the unused most-significant three bits within each
 * 16-bit suit field are immaterial.
 * <p>
 * A hand parameter can be built by encoding a {@link CardSet} or by bitwise
 * OR-ing, or adding, the encoded values of individual {@link Card}s.  These
 * encodings are returned by an {@link #encode encode} method.
 * <p>
 * Different methods are used for high and for lowball evaluation.
 * <p>
 * For high evaluation if results R1 > R2, hand 1 beats hand 2;
 * for lowball evaluation if results R1 > R2, hand 2 beats hand 1.
 * <p>
 * Evaluation result in 32 bits = 0x0V0RRRRR where V, R are
 * hex digits or "nybbles" (half-bytes).
 * <p>
 * V nybble = category code ranging from {@link HandCategory#NO_PAIR}<code>.ordinal()</code>
 *                                    to {@link HandCategory#STRAIGHT_FLUSH}<code>.ordinal()</code>
 * <p>
 * The R nybbles are the significant ranks (0..12), where 0 is the deuce
 * in a high result (Ace is 12, 0xC), and for lowball 0 is the Ace
 * (King is 0xC).  The Rs may be considered to consist of Ps for ranks
 * which determine the primary value of the hand, and Ks for kickers
 * where applicable.  Ordering is left-to-right:  first the Ps, then
 * any Ks, then padding with 0s.  Because 0 is a valid rank, to
 * interpret a result you must know how many ranks are significant,
 * which is a function of the hand category and whether high or lowball.
 * Examples: for a one-pair hand there are four significant ranks,
 * that of the pair and of the three kickers; for a straight, there is
 * one significant rank, that of the highest in the hand.
 * <p>
 * Common-card (board) games are assumed in determining the number of
 * significant ranks.  For example, a kicker value is returned for quads even
 * though it wouldn't be significant in a draw game.
 * <p><pre>
 * Examples of ...Eval method results (high where not indicated):
 *  Royal flush: 0x080C0000
 *  Four of a kind, Queens, with a 5 kicker:  0x070A3000
 *  Threes full of eights:  0x06016000
 *  Straight to the five (wheel): 0x04030000 (high)
 *  Straight to the five (wheel): 0x04040000 (lowball)
 *  One pair, deuces (0x0), with A65: 0x0100C430 (high)
 *  One pair, deuces (0x1), with 65A: 0x01015400 (lowball)
 *  No pair, KJT85: 0x000B9863
 *  Razz, wheel:  0x00043210</pre>
 * For the eight-or-better lowball ..._Eval functions, the result is
 * either as above or the constant {@link #NO_8_LOW}.  NO_8_LOW > any other
 * ..._Eval function result.
 * <p>
